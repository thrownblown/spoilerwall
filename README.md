# Beware! Spoilers ahead!

Spoilerwall introduces a brand new concept in the field of network hardening. Avoid being scanned by spoiling movies on all your ports!

Firewall? How about Fire'em'all! Stop spending thousand of dollars on big teams that you don't need! Just fire up the Spoilers Server and that's it!

Movie Spoilers DB + Open Ports + Pure Evil = Spoilerwall

Set your own:

1. Clone this repo

```
$ git clone git@github.com:infobyte/spoilerwall.git
```

2. Edit the file `server-spoiler.py` and set the **HOST** and **PORT** variables.

3. Run the server

```
$ python2 server-spoiler.py
```

The server will listen on the selected port (8080 by default). Redirect incoming TCP traffic in all ports to this service by running:

```
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 1:65535 -j DNAT --to-destination {HOST}:{PORT}
```

Change **{HOST}** and **{PORT}** for the values set in step (2). Also, if the traffic is redirected to localhost, run:

```
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth0.route_localnet=1
```

Using this config, an nmap scan will show every port as open and a spoiler for each one.
